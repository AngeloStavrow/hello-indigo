With the [release of v1.2.0], Indigo now supports custom CSS!

<!--more-->

To do so, add a file called `custom.css` in your site's `/static/css` folder (you'll have to create that folder if it doesn't already exist). In that file, you can add whatever custom styles you'd like, and they'll override any built-in styles.

You can see an example of this [here], which uses a custom palette as well as additional styling on [the updates page]; Angelo has written about the motivation for custom CSS in [this blog post] and shares his own [custom.css file].
